# Maïchef

Maïchef is a personalized cooking application conceived during a Hackathon. It allows users to create unique dishes based on their own ingredients.

## Project Origin

This project originated from a Hackathon where our team was tasked with developing an innovative solution. We focused on creating a cooking application that empowers users to personalize their culinary experience.

## Planned Features

*   Recipe generation based on user-provided ingredients.
*   Ingredient input and management.
*   User profiles with dietary restrictions and preferences.
*   Recipe saving and sharing.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3

## Challenges and Learnings

The Hackathon's short timeframe presented a significant challenge: translating our vision for Maïchef into a tangible presentation. While a fully functional application was beyond the scope of the event, we prioritized creating a compelling user experience through design and a working website prototype. This involved:

*   **Rapid Ideation and Design:** Quickly iterating on ideas and creating mockups/illustrations to visualize the app's interface and functionality.
*   **Website Prototyping:** Developing a functional website to demonstrate the core user flow and key features of Maïchef. This was a unique achievement within the Hackathon, as we were the only team to deliver a working website.
*   **Presentation Focus:** Crafting a clear and concise presentation to effectively communicate the value proposition of Maïchef to the jury.

This experience taught us a great deal about time management, prioritizing features for a minimum viable product (MVP), and the importance of a strong visual presentation in conveying a project's potential.
